# Project Status Report: WhisperEngine v2.5 Complete
**Date:** December 11, 2025
**Status:** Stable / Deployed
**Phase:** 2.5 (The Ship of Theseus) - COMPLETE

## 🚨 Executive Summary
Phase 2.5 is fully implemented and verified. The "Ship of Theseus" upgrade has successfully replaced the core cognitive architecture with a dual-process system (Fast/Slow thinking), event-driven autonomy (The Stream), and active idle processing (The Dream).

All systems are passing regression tests.

## 🛠️ Completed Features (Phase 2.5)

### 1. Unified Memory (Dual-Write Memory) ✅
- **Status:** Deployed
- **Mechanism:** Parallel writes to Qdrant (Vector) and Neo4j (Graph).
- **Benefit:** Enables both semantic search and structural relationship queries.
- **Verification:** `tests_v2/test_unified_memory_dual_write.py` passed.

### 2. The Stream (Event-Driven Autonomy) ✅
- **Status:** Deployed
- **Mechanism:** Redis-backed event loop with debouncing and distributed locking.
- **Key Components:**
    - `DailyLifeScheduler`: Manages the heartbeat.
    - `trigger_immediate()`: Allows high-priority events (mentions, trusted users) to bypass the poll cycle.
    - **Debounce:** 60s cooldown per bot to prevent spam.
    - **Locking:** Redis distributed locks ensure atomic execution of autonomous tasks.
- **Verification:** `tests_v2/test_stream_trigger.py` passed.

### 3. The Dream (Active Idle State) ✅
- **Status:** Deployed
- **Mechanism:** LangGraph workflow triggered after 2 hours of silence.
- **Flow:**
    1. **Silence Detection:** Scheduler notices inactivity.
    2. **Memory Retrieval:** Fetches recent interactions and "unprocessed" memories.
    3. **Dream Generation:** LLM synthesizes a surreal/symbolic narrative based on recent events.
    4. **Insight Extraction:** Analyzes the dream for hidden patterns or emotional shifts.
    5. **Graph Update:** Writes new insights to Neo4j.
- **Verification:** `tests_v2/test_dream_cycle.py` passed.

## 🧪 Verification & Stability
- **Regression Smoke Test:** PASSED (All 12 bots healthy).
- **Dream Cycle Test:** PASSED (End-to-end simulation of silence -> dream -> insight).
- **Stream Trigger Test:** PASSED (Debounce logic and mention bypass verified).

## 🔮 Next Steps: Phase 3 (The Collective)
With the individual cognitive architecture complete, we move to multi-agent dynamics.

1. **Shared Graph:** Allow bots to query a shared knowledge graph (with permission scopes).
2. **Cross-Bot Communication:** Formalize the protocol for bots to "hear" and respond to each other in shared channels.
3. **Group Dynamics:** Emergent behavior in multi-bot scenarios.
