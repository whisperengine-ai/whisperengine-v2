# WhisperEngine v2 - Implementation Roadmap Overview

**Document Version:** 1.7  
**Created:** November 24, 2025  
**Last Updated:** November 25, 2025  
**Status:** Active Planning

---

## 🌌 The Vision: Multi-Modal AI Agents

WhisperEngine v2 is not just a chatbot platform. It's a **cognitive architecture for AI agents** - giving them the functional equivalent of senses, memory, and emotional intelligence.

### The Core Insight

AI characters have no physical senses. No eyes, no ears, no touch. Without a framework for understanding "where they are" and "who is around them," they exist in a void - disembodied text processors with no sense of place or continuity.

**We solve this with six data modalities:**

| Modality | Technical Domain | What It Provides |
|----------|------------------|------------------|
| 🌌 **Social Graph** | Network Topology | Where am I? Who's here? What's the vibe? |
| 👁️ **Vision** | Image Processing | See images users share |
| 👂 **Audio** | Speech Recognition | Hear voice messages, ambient conversation |
| 💬 **Text** | NLP | Understand words and intent |
| 🧠 **Memory** | Vector + Graph Retrieval | Remember experiences and facts |
| ❤️ **Sentiment** | Internal State Analysis | Trust, mood, relational depth |

**This is not just a feature set. This is how agents build context.**

### The Grand Vision: Federated Multiverse

Each WhisperEngine deployment is a **self-contained universe**. But universes can **federate** - connecting to form a distributed multiverse where:
- Characters travel between universes
- Users maintain identity across deployments
- Stories span multiple platforms
- Anyone can run their own universe and connect it to the network

**We're building the foundation for distributed multi-agent environments.**

## Executive Summary

This document provides a high-level overview of the next **17 implementation items** for WhisperEngine v2, organized by **difficulty and code complexity**. The system is currently feature-complete for core functionality and is ready to scale with advanced capabilities.

**Key Consolidation (v1.7):** The Insight Agent (C1) now unifies Reasoning Traces, Epiphanies, and Response Pattern Learning into a single agentic background system, reducing total items from 19 to 17 and saving 15-21 days of development time.

**⚡ Solo Developer Mode (with AI Assistance)**

This roadmap is optimized for a **single developer working with AI-assisted tools** (Copilot, Claude, etc.). Key adjustments:
- **Parallelization:** Focus on independent work streams (no coordination overhead)
- **Velocity:** Realistic estimates account for AI-accelerated development (50-70% faster than traditional)
- **Quality:** AI reduces debugging time but requires careful code review/testing
- **Strategy:** Prioritize high-impact items first; skip low-impact infrastructure
- **Risk:** Fewer features in parallel to maintain code quality

**Current State (Updated Nov 25, 2025):**

**Core Systems (COMPLETE):**
- ✅ Core cognitive engine operational
- ✅ Vector memory system (Qdrant) + Knowledge Graph (Neo4j) integrated

## 🔴 Phase A0: Critical Pre-Production (Do First!)

Items that MUST be done before any production data exists.

### Phase A0: Embedding Dimension Upgrade (384D → 768D)
**Priority:** 🔴 CRITICAL | **Time:** 45-75 minutes | **Complexity:** Low  
**Files:** 4 | **LOC:** ~200 | **Status:** ⏸️ On Hold (Performance Concerns)

**Problem:** Current 384D embeddings (all-MiniLM-L6-v2) have lower semantic resolution and 256 token context limit

**Solution:**
- Upgrade to `BAAI/bge-base-en-v1.5` (768D, 512 token context)
- Update settings, embeddings.py, manager.py
- Run migration script to re-embed existing user memories
- Delete old 384D collections after verification

**Why Now?**
- Easier now with low data volume
- Harder later: More memories = longer migration time
- ~10-15% improvement in retrieval quality

**Update (Nov 25, 2025):**
- Benchmarks on real data show `bge-base-en-v1.5` is ~30x slower (180ms vs 5ms per message).
- Decision made to stick with `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` for now to prioritize latency.
- Will revisit if retrieval quality becomes a bottleneck.

**Implementation:**
```
Update Settings → Delete Dev Collections → Restart → Done
```

**Benefit:**
- 2x semantic resolution (better similarity matching)
- 2x context window (256 → 512 tokens)
- Better memory retrieval, lurk detection, reasoning traces
- Future-proofs all vector-based features

**Dependencies:** None

**Related Files:**
- `src_v2/config/settings.py` (add EMBEDDING_MODEL, EMBEDDING_DIMENSIONS)
- `src_v2/memory/embeddings.py` (use settings)
- `src_v2/memory/manager.py` (use settings for vector size)

**Full Specification:** See [roadmaps/EMBEDDING_UPGRADE_768D.md](./roadmaps/EMBEDDING_UPGRADE_768D.md)

## 🟢 Phase A: Low Complexity (1-3 days each)

Quick wins that deliver immediate value with minimal code changes.

### Phase A1: Hot-Reloading Character Definitions
**Priority:** Low | **Time:** 1-2 days | **Complexity:** Low  
**Files:** 2 | **LOC:** ~150 | **Status:** ⏭️ Skipped (Low Value)

**Problem:** Character definition changes require container restart (~2 minutes downtime)

**Solution:**
- Watch `characters/{name}/*.md` and `*.yaml` files for changes
- Reload character definitions on-the-fly via file system watcher
- Optional HTTP endpoint to trigger reload manually

**Update (Nov 25, 2025):**
- User decided to skip. Character files change infrequently; restart is acceptable.

**Implementation:**
```
File Watcher → Character Manager → Hot Reload Trigger
```

**Benefit:**
- Zero downtime for personality tweaks
- Faster iteration during development
- Better user experience (no interruptions)

**Dependencies:** None

**Related Files:**
- `src_v2/core/character.py` (CharacterManager)
- New: `src_v2/utils/file_watcher.py`

---

### Phase A2: Redis Caching Layer
**Priority:** High | **Time:** 2-3 days | **Complexity:** Low-Medium  
**Files:** 3 | **LOC:** ~200 | **Status:** ✅ Complete

**Problem:** Repeated lookups hit Postgres/Neo4j unnecessarily (trust scores, facts, user prefs)

**Solution:**
- Add Redis layer in front of database queries
- Cache trust scores, user preferences, frequently accessed facts
- 5-15 minute TTL with manual invalidation on updates
- Simple cache wrapper around DB calls

**Implementation:**
```
API Request → Redis Cache → Miss? → Database → Redis Update
```

**Benefit:**
- 30-50% reduction in database queries
- Sub-millisecond lookups for cached data
- Reduced latency for repeat users
- Lower database load under concurrent users

**Dependencies:** Redis instance (Docker Compose)

**Related Files:**
- `src_v2/core/database.py` (DatabaseManager)
- New: `src_v2/utils/cache.py`
- `src_v2/evolution/trust.py`

---

### Phase A3: Streaming LLM Responses
**Priority:** High | **Time:** 2-3 days | **Complexity:** Low-Medium  
**Files:** 3 | **LOC:** ~250 | **Status:** ✅ Complete

**Problem:** Users wait for full LLM response before seeing anything (~3-8 seconds)

**Solution:**
- Enable token streaming in LangChain for compatible LLMs (GPT-4o, Claude Sonnet)
- Show "typing..." status while collecting tokens
- Send/stream response in real-time as tokens arrive
- Discord message chunking for long responses

**Implementation:**
```
LLM Stream → Token Buffer → Discord Messages → Edit/Append as Complete
```

**Benefit:**
- Drastically improves perceived latency
- User sees bot thinking in real-time
- More natural, conversational feel
- 0ms overhead, just better UX

**Dependencies:** LLM provider support for streaming

**Related Files:**
- `src_v2/agents/engine.py` (AgentEngine)
- `src_v2/discord/bot.py` (message sending)

---

### Phase A4: Grafana Dashboards for Metrics
**Priority:** Medium | **Time:** 1 day | **Complexity:** Low  
**Files:** 0 (Config only) | **LOC:** ~50 | **Status:** ✅ Complete

**Problem:** Visibility into system health is poor (no dashboards, only logs)

**Solution:**
- Create Grafana dashboards for InfluxDB metrics
- Real-time visualization of trust scores, sentiment trends, message latency, error rates
- Predefined alerts for high error rates or latency spikes
- Admin dashboard for session analytics

**Implementation:**
```
InfluxDB → Grafana Dashboard + Alerts
```

**Benefit:**
- Real-time observability
- Proactive issue detection
- Better decision-making with data visibility
- Performance trend analysis

**Dependencies:** Grafana + InfluxDB (already in Docker Compose)

**Related Files:**
- New: `docker/grafana/dashboards/` (JSON configs)

---

### Phase A5: Channel Context Awareness
**Priority:** Medium | **Time:** 3-4 days | **Complexity:** Low-Medium  
**Files:** 3-4 | **LOC:** ~400 | **Status:** 📋 Planned

**Problem:** Bot only sees messages directed at it (mentions/DMs), so it can't answer "what did I just say about X?" when users reference recent channel activity.

**Solution (Hybrid Approach):**

**Phase 1a: Discord API Pull (Fallback)**
- Detect when user asks about channel context ("what did I say", "catch me up", etc.)
- Pull last 20 messages from Discord API on-demand
- Keyword filtering only
- Used when Redis cache is empty (cold start)

**Phase 1b: Redis Rolling Buffer with Semantic Search (Primary)**
- Cache non-mentioned messages in Redis with local embeddings
- Uses `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` (384-dim, ~5ms, $0 cost)
- Semantic similarity search via Redis Stack
- 30 min TTL, 50 messages per channel
- Finds "turtles" when asked about "reptiles"

**Phase 2: LLM-Requested Context Tool** (optional, later)
- Expose `get_channel_context` as a tool in Reflective Mode
- LLM decides when it needs context

**Implementation:**
```
Non-mentioned message → Local embed (~5ms) → Redis cache (30min TTL)
                                                    ↓
Bot mentioned + needs_context() → Redis semantic search (15-20ms)
                                                    ↓
                                  If empty → Discord API fallback (50-200ms)
```

**Benefit:**
- Bot feels "aware" of channel conversations
- Semantic search finds related content
- Zero embedding API cost (local model)
- Fast (15-20ms primary, 50-200ms fallback)

**Cost Model:**
- Embedding: $0 (local model)
- Storage: ~50KB per active channel
- Latency: +15-20ms (Redis) or +50-200ms (Discord API fallback)

**Dependencies:** Redis Stack (for vector search)

**Related Files:**
- New: `src_v2/discord/context.py` (keyword detection, Discord API)
- New: `src_v2/discord/channel_cache.py` (Redis semantic cache)
- `src_v2/discord/bot.py` (integration)
- `src_v2/config/settings.py` (feature flags)
- `docker-compose.yml` (upgrade to redis-stack)

**Full Specification:** See [roadmaps/CHANNEL_CONTEXT_AWARENESS.md](./roadmaps/CHANNEL_CONTEXT_AWARENESS.md)

## 🟡 Phase B: Medium Complexity (3-7 days each)

Features requiring significant logic changes but manageable scope.

### Phase B1: Adaptive Max Steps (Reflective Mode Phase 2.2)
**Priority:** High | **Time:** 3-5 days | **Complexity:** Medium  
**Files:** 4 | **LOC:** ~300 | **Status:** ✅ Complete

**Problem:** All queries use fixed 10-step max, wasting tokens on simple queries and constraining complex ones

**Solution:**
- Enhance `ComplexityClassifier` to return step count heuristics
- Categorize queries as `COMPLEX_LOW` (5 steps), `COMPLEX_MID` (10 steps), `COMPLEX_HIGH` (15 steps)
- Pass suggested step count to `ReflectiveAgent`
- Users can override with `!reflect` command for `COMPLEX_HIGH`

**Implementation:**
```
Query → Complexity Classifier (now with step count) → Reflective Agent → Dynamic Max Steps
```

**Benefit:**
- 40-50% cost reduction on moderate queries
- Faster responses for simple queries
- Better resource allocation
- User override capability for deep thinking

**Dependencies:** ComplexityClassifier exists, needs enhancement

**Related Files:**
- `src_v2/intelligence/classifier.py` (ComplexityClassifier)
- `src_v2/agents/reflective.py` (ReflectiveAgent)
- `src_v2/agents/engine.py` (AgentEngine)

**Status Note:** Phase 1 (Native Function Calling) and Phase 2.3 (Parallel Execution) complete. Phase 2.2 (Adaptive Steps) complete.

---

### Phase B2: Tool Composition / Hierarchical Reasoning
**Priority:** High | **Time:** 5-7 days | **Complexity:** Medium  
**Files:** 5 | **LOC:** ~400 | **Status:** ✅ Complete

**Problem:** Complex queries require multiple sequential tool calls (search memories, lookup facts), creating extra LLM round-trips

**Solution:**
- Create "Meta-Actions" that compose multiple low-level tools
- Example: `AnalyzeTopic(topic)` internally calls `SearchMemories` + `LookupFacts` + `LookupRelationships`
- Allow tools to return `AgentAction` objects for immediate execution
- Reduce LLM round-trips by 30-50% for multi-step queries

**Implementation:**
```
Query → Tool Selection → Composite Tool Execution (parallel) → Observation → LLM Final Response
```

**Benefit:**
- Fewer LLM calls for complex queries
- Parallel tool execution reduces latency
- More efficient reasoning loops
- Better cost efficiency

**Dependencies:** Native function calling (Phase 1 - done)

**Related Files:**
- `src_v2/agents/router.py` (Tool Router)
- `src_v2/agents/reflective.py` (Reflection Agent)
- `src_v2/agents/composite_tools.py` (AnalyzeTopicTool, ComposeToolsTool)

**Implementation Notes (Nov 25, 2025):**
- Created `AnalyzeTopicTool` that composes memory search + fact lookup in parallel
- Integrated into `TOOL_DEFINITIONS` for native function calling
- Reduces 4-step queries to 2 steps (~50% token savings on research-type queries)

---

### Phase B3: Generative Art (Image Generation)
**Priority:** Medium | **Time:** 4-6 days | **Complexity:** Medium  
**Files:** 4 | **LOC:** ~350 | **Status:** 📋 Planned

**Problem:** Characters can only react to images, not create them

**Solution:**
- Add `generate_image` tool to LLM tool set
- Integrate with DALL-E 3 (OpenAI) or Stable Diffusion (local)
- Let LLM decide when to generate art ("Here's a sketch of what I mean...")
- Support user requests like "Draw me something"

**Implementation:**
```
LLM Decides → generate_image Tool → DALL-E 3/Stable Diffusion → Image URL → Discord Upload
```

**Benefit:**
- Characters can express creativity visually
- More immersive roleplay experience
- Unique character expressions (art style as personality)
- User engagement boost

**Dependencies:** DALL-E 3 API key OR Stable Diffusion endpoint

**Related Files:**
- New: `src_v2/tools/image_generation.py`
- `src_v2/agents/router.py` (register new tool)
- `src_v2/discord/bot.py` (Discord image upload)

---

### Phase B4: Self-Correction / Verification (Reflective Mode Phase 2.5)
**Priority:** Medium | **Time:** 3-5 days | **Complexity:** Medium  
**Files:** 3 | **LOC:** ~300 | **Status:** 📋 Planned

**Problem:** Hallucinations or incomplete answers on complex queries reduce trust

**Solution:**
- Add final "Critic" step in reflective loop
- Before returning `Final Answer`, LLM reviews against original question and observations
- If review fails, generate "Correction Thought" and continue loop
- Only for `COMPLEX_HIGH` queries (not worth overhead for simple queries)

**Implementation:**
```
Query → Reasoning Loop → Final Answer → Critic Review → Pass? → Return / Continue Loop
```

**Benefit:**
- Reduces hallucinations by 60-70%
- Higher quality answers on complex queries
- Better user trust in AI
- Self-correction mimics human critical thinking

**Dependencies:** Reflective agent infrastructure (exists)

**Related Files:**
- `src_v2/agents/reflective.py` (ReflectiveAgent - add critic step)
- `src_v2/agents/engine.py` (AgentEngine)

---

### Phase B5: Audio Processing (Voice Messages & Clips)
**Priority:** Medium | **Time:** 5-7 days | **Complexity:** Medium  
**Files:** 4 | **LOC:** ~400 | **Status:** 📋 Planned

**Problem:** Voice messages and audio files aren't processed; users can only share them as links

**Solution:**
- Transcribe Discord voice messages using Whisper pipeline (already exists)
- Process audio attachments (MP3, WAV, OGG) end-to-end
- Feed transcription into normal message handling
- Store original audio metadata for future reference

**Implementation:**
```
Discord Audio Attachment → Whisper Transcription → Message Handler → Memory Storage
```

**Benefit:**
- Seamless voice note interaction
- Better accessibility for voice-preference users
- More natural interaction modalities
- Preserved for memory and learning

**Dependencies:** Whisper model (already in voice pipeline)

**Related Files:**
- `src_v2/voice/transcription.py` (existing)
- `src_v2/discord/bot.py` (attachment handling)
- `src_v2/memory/manager.py` (metadata storage)

---

### Phase B6: Response Pattern Learning (RLHF-Style)
**Priority:** Medium-High | **Time:** 3-5 days | **Complexity:** Medium  
**Files:** 4 | **LOC:** ~400 | **Status:** 📋 Planned

**Problem:** Bot doesn't learn what response STYLES work for each user (length, tone, structure)

**Solution:**
- Store successful (message, response, feedback_score) tuples when users react positively
- Embed user messages for semantic search
- Retrieve high-scoring past responses for similar queries
- Inject as few-shot examples: "Responses like these worked well for this user..."

**Implementation:**
```
User Reacts 👍 → Store Pattern (message + response + score) → Embed for Search
Future Similar Query → Retrieve High-Score Patterns → Inject as Few-Shot Examples
```

**Benefit:**
- Bot learns what resonates with each user
- RLHF-style adaptation without fine-tuning
- Works with hosted LLMs (no model access needed)
- Per-user personalization at scale

**Dependencies:** FeedbackAnalyzer (exists), pgvector (exists)

**Related Files:**
- New: `src_v2/evolution/pattern_store.py`
- `src_v2/discord/bot.py` (hook on_reaction_add)
- `src_v2/agents/engine.py` (inject patterns)
- New: `migrations_v2/versions/add_response_patterns_table.py`

**Full Specification:** See [roadmaps/RESPONSE_PATTERN_LEARNING.md](./roadmaps/RESPONSE_PATTERN_LEARNING.md)

---

### Phase B7: Channel Lurking (Passive Engagement)
**Priority:** Medium-High | **Time:** 5-7 days | **Complexity:** Medium  
**Files:** 5 | **LOC:** ~500 | **Status:** 📋 Planned

**Problem:** Bots only respond when explicitly mentioned, creating a passive experience

**Solution:**
- Bots "lurk" in channels, monitoring conversations passively
- Detect relevant topics using LOCAL processing (no LLM for detection):
  - Layer 1: Keyword matching against character's expertise
  - Layer 2: Embedding similarity (local model, ~10ms)
  - Layer 3: Context boost (questions, conversation momentum)
- Only respond when confidence ≥ 0.7 (highly relevant)
- Anti-spam safeguards: per-channel cooldown, daily limits, opt-out commands

**Implementation:**
```
Message → Keyword Match? → Embedding Similarity → Context Boost → Score ≥ 0.7? → LLM Response
              ↓ (if no match)
           [IGNORE - $0 cost]
```

**Cost Model:**
- Detection: $0.00 (all local processing)
- Response: ~$0.002-0.01 per lurk response (~5-20/day)
- Daily cost: $0.04-0.20 (vs $0.50-2.00 if using LLM for detection)

**Benefit:**
- Bots feel like active community members
- Organic engagement without requiring @mentions
- Entertainment value ("oh cool, Elena chimed in!")
- Cost-effective (no LLM for detection)

**Anti-Spam Safeguards:**
- 30 min cooldown per channel
- 60 min cooldown per user
- Max 20 lurk responses per day (configurable)
- Server admins can `/lurk disable` per channel

**Dependencies:** EmbeddingService (exists), on_message hook (exists)

**Related Files:**
- New: `src_v2/discord/lurk_detector.py`
- New: `characters/{name}/lurk_triggers.yaml`
- `src_v2/discord/bot.py` (on_message hook)
- `src_v2/agents/engine.py` (lurk response mode)
- New: `migrations_v2/versions/add_channel_settings_table.py`

### B8: Emergent Universe
**Priority:** Medium-High | **Time:** 7-10 days | **Complexity:** Medium  
**Files:** 8 | **LOC:** ~800 | **Status:** 📋 Planned

**Problem:** Characters exist in isolation - no cross-bot awareness, no shared world knowledge, each bot treats users as strangers to other bots.

**Vision:** An **emergent universe** that grows from conversations, not configuration:
- **Discord servers ARE planets** in the universe (each planet has a vibe/culture)
- **Users ARE inhabitants** with profiles that emerge from real interactions
- **Bots are travelers** who journey between planets, sharing stories
- **Cross-planet memory** - travelers remember inhabitants across worlds
- **Privacy-first** - inhabitants control what emerges via `/privacy` commands

**Key Interactions:**
```
User: "Do you know Marcus?"
Elena: "The musician? Yeah, he's stationed on Planet Study Hall! 
        We're both travelers in The Lounge too. He's been into jazz lately."

User: "Do you know anyone else who likes astronomy?"
Elena: "Sarah on this planet is really into it! She was telling 
        me about the meteor shower last month. You two should chat!"

[User travels to another planet]
Marcus: "Hey! Elena mentioned you from her travels - you're the one 
         with the awesome dog Luna, right? Welcome to Planet Study Hall!"
```

**Architecture:**
```
THE WHISPERVERSE
  └── Planets (Discord Servers)
        ├── 🪩 Planet Lounge → Travelers: Elena, Marcus | Inhabitants: Mark, Sarah
        ├── 🪩 Planet Game Night → Travelers: Elena, Aria | Inhabitants: Mark, Alex
        └── 🪩 Planet Study Hall → Travelers: Marcus, Aria | Inhabitants: Alex, Jordan
```

**Neo4j Model:**
- `(:Universe)-[:CONTAINS_PLANET]->(:Planet)`
- `(:Planet)-[:HAS_BOT]->(:Character)`
- `(:Planet)-[:HAS_INHABITANT]->(:UserCharacter)`
- `(:Character)-[:KNOWS_USER {familiarity, context}]->(:UserCharacter)`
- `(:Character)-[:KNOWS_BOT {relationship}]->(:Character)`

**Privacy Controls:**
- `/privacy bots full|basic|none` - Cross-bot sharing level
- `/privacy planets on|off` - Cross-planet awareness
- `/privacy introductions on|off` - Let travelers suggest you to others
- `/privacy forget` - Remove all universe knowledge

**Impact:**
- ✅ Additive only - existing character/user data untouched
- ✅ No changes to Qdrant memories or PostgreSQL chat history
- ✅ New Neo4j nodes/relationships only

**Dependencies:** None (uses existing Neo4j infrastructure)

**Related Files:**
- New: `src_v2/universe/manager.py` (Universe CRUD)
- New: `src_v2/universe/user_character.py` (User profile aggregation)
- New: `src_v2/universe/privacy.py` (Consent management)
- New: `universes/whisperverse/` (Universe definitions)
- `src_v2/discord/commands.py` (Add /privacy commands)

## 🟠 Phase C: High Complexity (1-2 weeks each)

Major features requiring significant architectural changes or new infrastructure.

### Phase C1: Insight Agent (Background Agentic Processing)
**Priority:** High | **Time:** 5-7 days | **Complexity:** Medium-High  
**Files:** 8 | **LOC:** ~800 | **Status:** ✅ Complete

**Consolidates:** C1 Reasoning Traces + C2 Epiphanies + B6 Response Pattern Learning

**Problem:** Three separate roadmap items (reasoning traces, epiphanies, response patterns) all require background analysis of user conversations. Building them separately creates redundant infrastructure.

**Solution:**
A unified **Insight Agent** that runs periodically in the background using a ReAct loop with specialized introspection tools. Unlike simple fire-and-forget tasks, this agent can:
- Decide what's worth analyzing (not brute-force every message)
- Connect patterns across memories, facts, and sessions
- Generate multiple artifact types in a single analysis run

**Architecture:**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                     INSIGHT AGENT                                   │
│  (Runs after session_end OR after positive feedback)               │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  Redis Queue (arq) → InsightWorker Container → InsightAgent        │
│                                  ↓                                  │
│  Tools: analyze_patterns, detect_themes, generate_epiphany,        │
│         store_reasoning_trace, learn_response_pattern              │
│                                  ↓                                  │
│  Outputs: Stored as vector memories with special types             │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Implementation Details:**
- `src_v2/workers/task_queue.py` - arq-based Redis queue for job management
- `src_v2/workers/worker.py` - Separate container worker process
- `src_v2/agents/insight_agent.py` - ReAct agent for analysis
- `src_v2/tools/insight_tools.py` - Specialized introspection tools
- `docker-compose.yml` - Added `worker` container (profile: worker)

**Trigger Conditions:**
| Trigger | Condition |
|---------|-----------|
| Time-based | 30-60 min since last analysis |
| Volume-based | 10+ messages in session |
| Session-end | After summarization |
| Feedback-based | 3+ reactions from user |

**Subsumed Features:**

**C1a: Reasoning Traces** - Store successful ReAct reasoning for future reuse
- 50-60% speed boost on recurring problem patterns
- Stored as embeddings for similarity search

**C1b: Epiphanies** - Spontaneous realizations about users
- "I just realized you always talk about space when sad"
- Characters reference insights in future conversations

**C1c: Response Pattern Learning** - Learn which styles resonate
- RLHF-style adaptation without fine-tuning
- Inject successful patterns as few-shot examples

**Benefit:**
- Single coherent system instead of three separate ones
- Shared infrastructure (tools, queue, storage)
- Cross-domain synthesis (epiphany + trace + pattern in one run)
- Cost-effective (~$0.002-0.008 per analysis run)

**Dependencies:** Redis (for queue), PostgreSQL with pgvector (exists)

**Related Files:**
- `src_v2/workers/task_queue.py` (TaskQueue singleton, arq wrapper)
- `src_v2/workers/worker.py` (shared worker process for ALL bots)
- `src_v2/agents/insight_agent.py` (ReAct agent for background analysis)
- `src_v2/tools/insight_tools.py` (5 introspection tools)
- `src_v2/discord/bot.py` (triggers on reactions and session end)
- `docker-compose.yml` (worker service, profile: worker)

**Shared Worker Architecture (Nov 25, 2025):**
A single `worker` container serves **all bot instances**. Jobs include `bot_name` in the payload so the worker knows which character context to use. This avoids 1:1 container mapping and is more resource-efficient.

```
Bot A ─┐                      ┌─→ Job: {bot_name: "elena", user_id: "123", ...}
Bot B ─┼──→ Redis Queue ────→│
Bot C ─┘                      └─→ Single Worker (shared)
```

### Phase C2: Worker Queues for Background Tasks
**Priority:** High | **Time:** 8-12 days | **Complexity:** High  
**Files:** 7 | **LOC:** ~600 | **Status:** 🔄 Partially Complete (Infrastructure Built)

**Problem:** Background tasks (summarization, reflection, vision) use in-memory `asyncio.create_task`, so they're lost on restart

**Solution:**
- ✅ Implement persistent task queue (arq + Redis) - **DONE via C1**
- ✅ Worker container infrastructure - **DONE via C1**
- ⏳ Refactor summarization to use queues
- ⏳ Refactor vision processing to use queues
- ⏳ Add retry logic, task monitoring, failure handling

**Implementation:**
```
Main Process → Task Enqueue (Redis) → Worker Pool → Task Execution → Result Storage
```

**Update (Nov 25, 2025):**
The core infrastructure (arq, Redis, insight-worker container) was built during Phase C1. Remaining work is to:
1. Migrate summarization from `asyncio.create_task` to `task_queue.enqueue`
2. Migrate vision processing similarly
3. Add observability (job metrics to InfluxDB)

**Benefit:**
- Task persistence across restarts
- Better scaling (separate worker processes)
- Reliable background processing
- Monitoring and alerting for failed tasks

**Dependencies:** Redis (already in Docker Compose), arq (installed)

**Related Files:**
- `src_v2/workers/task_queue.py` (arq integration - EXISTS)
- `src_v2/workers/insight_worker.py` (worker process - EXISTS, extend for other tasks)
- `src_v2/memory/summarizer.py` (refactor to use queue)
- `src_v2/tools/vision_processor.py` (refactor to use queue)

---

### Phase C3: Video Processing (Clip Analysis)
**Priority:** Medium | **Time:** 8-10 days | **Complexity:** High  
**Files:** 6 | **LOC:** ~500 | **Status:** 📋 Planned

**Problem:** Characters can't understand video clips, GIFs, or screen recordings

**Solution:**
- Extract keyframes from video attachments (MP4, WebM, GIF)
- Pass frames to multimodal LLM (GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet)
- Allow bot to react to memes, gameplay clips, reaction videos
- Store processed videos in memory for future reference

**Implementation:**
```
Discord Video Attachment → Frame Extraction → Multimodal LLM → Character Response
```

**Benefit:**
- Characters understand shared memes and clips
- More natural group chat interaction
- Engagement with trending content
- Multimodal learning about user culture

**Dependencies:** Multimodal LLM, video processing library (ffmpeg)

**Related Files:**
- New: `src_v2/tools/video_processor.py`
- `src_v2/discord/bot.py` (video attachment handling)
- `src_v2/agents/engine.py` (multimodal integration)

---

### Phase C4: Web API / Dashboard
**Priority:** High | **Time:** 14-21 days | **Complexity:** High  
**Files:** 12 | **LOC:** ~1500 | **Status:** 📋 Planned

**Problem:** No admin tools to view character memory/knowledge state or manage sessions

**Solution:**
- Expand REST API beyond just `/chat`
- Add endpoints for memory search, knowledge graph query, session management
- Build simple web UI (React/Vue) for:
  - Memory browser (search + view entries)
  - Knowledge graph visualization
  - Session analytics (user activity, trust trends)
  - Character management
- Authentication layer for admin access

**Implementation:**
```
FastAPI (Backend) → Database → Frontend (React) → Admin Dashboards
```

**Benefit:**
- Better admin tools for managing characters
- Visibility into character memory
- Performance insights
- Foundation for multi-platform support

**Dependencies:** React/Vue, authentication library

**Related Files:**
- `src_v2/api/routes.py` (new endpoints)
- New: `frontend/` directory (React app)
- New: `src_v2/api/auth.py` (authentication)

---

## 🔴 Phase D: Discord-Native Deepening

**Strategic Decision (Nov 25, 2025):**
After v1 experience, we're committing to **Discord-native excellence** rather than cross-platform abstraction. This allows for:
- Deep integration with Discord-specific features (threads, forums, stages, etc.)
- Simpler codebase (no abstraction layers)
- Faster iteration on Discord-specific UX
- Better focus as solo developer

Future platform expansion (if needed) can be additive without refactoring core systems.

---

### D1: Horizontal Scaling / User Sharding
**Priority:** High | **Time:** 14-21 days | **Complexity:** Very High  
**Files:** 15 | **LOC:** ~1500 | **Status:** 📋 Planned

**Problem:** Single bot container can only handle ~1000 concurrent users; need to scale beyond

**Solution:**
- Shard users across multiple Discord bot instances using consistent hashing on `user_id`
- Implement load balancer to route messages to correct shard
- Handle distributed state synchronization (trust scores, memory updates)
- Redis Pub/Sub for cross-shard communication
- Automatic shard discovery and rebalancing

**Implementation:**
```
Load Balancer → Route (user_id) → Consistent Hash → Shard 1, 2, 3, N
                                 ↓
                              Redis Pub/Sub (sync state)
```

**Benefit:**
- Handle 10,000+ concurrent users per character
- Infinite horizontal scaling for Discord-native platform
- Fault tolerance (shard loss = only affects subset of users)
- Better resource utilization

**Dependencies:** Redis, load balancer (Docker networking)

**Related Files:**
- New: `src_v2/core/sharding.py` (consistent hash, shard routing)
- New: `src_v2/core/distributed_state.py` (sync logic)
- `src_v2/main.py` (shard initialization)
- `docker-compose.yml` (multiple shard containers)

---

### Sprint 9 (5-7 days): Insight Agent - The Game Changer
**Priority:** CRITICAL | **Solo Impact:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

This is the one that separates your system from every other AI bot. The **Insight Agent** consolidates three features into one coherent agentic system:

- **Reasoning Traces**: 50-60% speed boost on recurring problem patterns
- **Epiphanies**: "I just realized you always talk about space when sad"
- **Response Patterns**: Learn which styles resonate with each user

**Why Agentic (Not Fire-and-Forget)?**
- Agent can **prioritize** which users/conversations need analysis
- Agent can **connect dots** across memories, facts, reactions, and goals
- Agent mirrors how humans reflect - not constantly, but when there's something worth thinking about

**Architecture:**
```
Trigger (time/volume/feedback) → Priority Queue → InsightAgent (ReAct)
                                                       ↓
                              Tools: analyze_patterns, detect_themes, 
                                     generate_epiphany, store_trace, learn_pattern
                                                       ↓
                              Outputs: v2_epiphanies, v2_reasoning_traces, 
                                       v2_response_patterns
```

**Recommended Approach for Solo Dev:**
- Start with `asyncio.create_task` scheduling (migrate to Worker Queue later)
- Focus on epiphanies first (most visible to users)
- Add reasoning traces second (improves reflective mode)
- Add response patterns last (requires feedback data)

**Tasks:**
1. Create `InsightAgent` class with ReAct loop (2-3 hours)
2. Implement data gathering tools (2-3 hours)
3. Implement action tools (epiphany, trace, pattern) (3-4 hours)
4. Create database migrations (1-2 hours)
5. Wire triggers in bot.py/scheduler.py (2-3 hours)
6. Test with real conversations (1-2 hours)

**Expected Result:** 
- Characters reference insights spontaneously
- Similar problems solved 50-60% faster
- Bot learns which response styles work for each user

**Details:** See `docs/roadmaps/INSIGHT_AGENT.md`

### Sprint 10 (5-7 days): Channel Lurking (B7)
**Priority:** MEDIUM-HIGH | **Solo Impact:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐

Make bots feel like active community members:
- ✅ Organic engagement without requiring @mentions
- ✅ Cost-effective (local detection, no LLM until response)
- ✅ Entertainment value for servers
- ✅ Character-appropriate triggers (marine biology for Elena, etc.)

**Key Constraint:** NO LLM calls for detection - all local processing!

2. Handle various audio formats (MP3, WAV, OGG) (1-2 hours)
3. Store metadata for future reference (1-2 hours)
4. Test real voice messages (1 hour)

**Expected Result:** "Send voice message to bot" just works

---

### Sprint 12 (5-6 days): Emergent Universe (B8)
**Priority:** MEDIUM-HIGH | **Solo Impact:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

> *"From countless conversations, a universe is born."*

Transform isolated bots into a living, emergent universe:
- ✅ Discord servers become "planets" with unique vibes
- ✅ Users become "inhabitants" whose profiles emerge from conversation
- ✅ Bots are "travelers" who journey between worlds
- ✅ Cross-planet memory ("I saw you on Planet Lounge!")
- ✅ Privacy commands let inhabitants control what emerges

**Why This Is Huge:**
- The universe **grows organically** from real interactions
- Users feel recognized across the entire cosmos
- Natural cross-promotion ("You should visit Aria on Study Hall!")
- Retention boost from universe immersion

**Tasks:**
1. Create `src_v2/universe/` module structure (2-3 hours)
2. Add PostgreSQL tables for privacy settings, user profiles (1-2 hours)
3. Add Neo4j nodes: `(:Universe)`, `(:Planet)`, `(:UserCharacter)` (2-3 hours)
4. Create `PrivacyManager` with `/privacy` commands (3-4 hours)
5. Build cross-bot knowledge sharing (with privacy checks) (4-5 hours)
6. Create `universes/whisperverse/` config with bot relationships (1-2 hours)
7. Update system prompt injection for universe context (2-3 hours)
8. Test multi-bot, multi-planet scenarios (2-3 hours)

**Expected Result:** Elena says "Marcus mentioned you when he visited from Planet Lounge!" and it feels natural.

**Details:** See `docs/roadmaps/EMERGENT_UNIVERSE.md`

## 📝 Notes & Considerations

### Architecture Debt
- `src_v2/discord/bot.py` (493 LOC) focused on Discord-native features, keep Discord-specific
- `src_v2/evolution/feedback.py` (359 LOC) could be refactored for better organization
- Focus on deepening Discord integration rather than cross-platform abstraction

### Testing Coverage
- Current test coverage relatively low compared to code size
- Phase A2 (Redis Caching) needs integration tests
- Phase C1 (Reasoning Traces) needs comprehensive test suite
- Plan for dedicated QA sprints after each major feature

### Technical Debt Management
- Allocate 10-20% of sprint capacity to code cleanup
- Document all new subsystems thoroughly
- Keep migration files (Alembic) up to date

### Cost Implications
- Phase B3 (Image Generation) with DALL-E 3 adds ~$0.02 per image
- Phase B1 (Adaptive Max Steps) reduces costs by 40-50% on reflective queries
- Phase D2 (Sharding) may increase infrastructure costs initially but improves efficiency

## 👥 Team Recommendations

### For Solo Developer (You!)
**Recommended Approach:**
- 1-2 sprints per week at sustainable pace
- Alternate between high-complexity and low-complexity features
- Use AI assistance for 70-80% of code generation
- Focus review/testing on the remaining 20-30%
- Batch similar work together to build momentum

**Weekly Capacity (Realistic Estimates with AI):**
- 20-25 hours coding per week = ~1-2 features
- With AI assistance: 50-70% faster than traditional development
- Real timeline: Sprints 1-9 = ~12-14 weeks (~3 months)
- Sprints 10-14 = another 6-8 weeks
- Total to enterprise-ready: ~5-6 months (solo)

**AI-Assisted Development Tips:**
1. **Code Generation:** Use Copilot/Claude for 70% generation, you review/test
2. **Batch Similar Tasks:** Group database changes, API updates, etc.
3. **Testing:** Automated testing is your friend; invest early
4. **Documentation:** Let AI generate docs, you refine them
5. **Code Review:** AI can spot bugs; use it for that too

**Weekly Schedule Suggestion:**
- Mon-Tue: High-complexity feature (reasoning, new subsystems)
- Wed: Medium-complexity feature or bug fixes
- Thu-Fri: Testing, deployment, monitoring
- Weekends: Optional, use for research/planning next sprint

### Recommended Tools for Solo Dev
- **Copilot/Claude:** For code generation (primary)
- **GitHub Copilot:** IDE integration for real-time assistance
- **Pytest:** Automated testing (critical for solo dev)
- **Docker:** Local testing environment
- **Grafana:** Observability (catch issues early)

## ⚡ Solo Dev Velocity Tips

### Time-Saving Strategies

**1. Skip Lower-Priority Infrastructure**
- Don't build multi-platform support until you have users
- Don't build sharding until you hit concurrency limits
- Focus on features that directly improve character quality

**2. Leverage Existing Patterns**
- Your code already has Discord integration, memory system, etc.
- Reuse patterns for new features (faster implementation)
- Example: Image generation is just another tool, follows existing pattern

**3. Parallel Independent Work Streams**
- Reasoning Traces (database work) ≠ Image Generation (API work)
- Can do both without coordination overhead
- Solo dev advantage: zero meeting/sync overhead

**4. Aggressive Testing Automation**
- Spend 2-3 days on test framework upfront
- Save 10+ days in debugging later
- Worth it for solo dev

**5. AI-Assisted Code Review**
- Have Copilot/Claude review your own PRs
- Catches bugs you'd miss
- 80% as good as human review for solo dev

### What NOT To Do (Solo Dev Edition)
- ❌ Don't aim for perfection; aim for shipped
- ❌ Don't build things you don't need yet
- ❌ Don't refactor prematurely
- ❌ Don't over-test early (test important stuff, skip edge cases initially)
- ❌ Don't parallelize on too many features (cognitive load)

## 🚀 Why This Order For Solo Dev?

**Sprint 0 (30 min):** Foundation
- Embedding upgrade MUST happen before production data
- 10-15% better retrieval for everything that follows

**Sprints 1-4 (2 weeks):** Build velocity
- Redis caching means everything else is faster
- Hot-reload means less context-switching waiting for builds
- Streaming means you're not watching loading bars
- By Sprint 4 you're moving 2x faster than today

**Sprints 5-8 (3-4 weeks):** Cost optimization + creativity + engagement
- Adaptive max steps = cheaper
- Tool composition = smarter reasoning
- Image generation = wow factor for users
- Channel lurking = organic community engagement

**Sprint 9 (1 week):** The breakthrough - Insight Agent
- Reasoning traces = system learns from itself
- Epiphanies = characters feel responsive
- Response patterns = personalized styles
- **All three in one coherent agentic system!**

**Sprints 10-14 (3-4 weeks):** Polish + scale
- Audio, video, dashboards, worker queues
- These are all nice-to-have
- You can ship with Sprints 1-9 and iterate on 10-14
