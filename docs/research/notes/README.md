# Research Notes

Informal notes, explorations, and working documents that don't fit formal report structures.

## Contents

- **[NOTE-001-CAL_TRIANGLE_ANALYSIS.md](NOTE-001-CAL_TRIANGLE_ANALYSIS.md)** - Analysis of CAL (Complexity-Autonomy-Learning) triangle concept
- **[TOOL_ROUTING_EMBEDDINGS.md](TOOL_ROUTING_EMBEDDINGS.md)** - Notes on using embeddings for tool routing

## Purpose

This folder is for:
- Brainstorming and rough drafts
- Technical explorations that may become features
- Analysis fragments that don't warrant full reports
- Working notes during development

Think of this as the "scratch pad" - less formal than observations or experiments, but still worth preserving.
