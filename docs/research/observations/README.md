# Observation Reports

Qualitative deep-dive analyses of specific emergent behaviors and patterns observed in the WhisperEngine system.

## Reports

## Observation vs. Quantitative Reports

**Observations** (this folder) are qualitative:
- Deep analysis of specific patterns
- Case studies of emergent behaviors
- Exploration of causation and mechanisms
- Hypothesis generation

**Emergence Observations** ([../emergence_observations/](../emergence_observations/)) are quantitative:
- System-wide metrics and scoring
- Rankings across all bots
- Statistical patterns over time
- Data-driven assessments

## Writing Observations

Use clear structure:
1. **Executive Summary** - What was observed?
2. **Phenomenon** - Detailed description with evidence
3. **Causal Analysis** - Why did it happen?
4. **Novel Observations** - What's new or surprising?
5. **Research Questions** - What does this open up?
6. **Proposed Experiments** - How to test hypotheses?
