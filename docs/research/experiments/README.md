# Experiments

Formal hypothesis-driven experiments testing specific behaviors or features.

## Active Experiments

- **[E001_emergent_self_awareness.md](E001_emergent_self_awareness.md)** - Testing whether bots develop awareness of their own architecture through exposure to system documentation

## Experiment Process

1. **Hypothesis** - What do we expect to happen?
2. **Method** - How will we test it?
3. **Success Criteria** - What would confirm/reject the hypothesis?
4. **Results** - What actually happened?
5. **Analysis** - What does it mean?

Use the [EXPERIMENT.md](../templates/EXPERIMENT.md) template for new experiments.

## Proposed Experiments (from observations)

From [BOT_INITIATION_EMERGENCE_20251204.md](../observations/BOT_INITIATION_EMERGENCE_20251204.md):
- **Test Elena's Connection Drive**: Increase to 0.95 to see if she initiates more conversations
- **Add Philosophical Purpose to Dotty**: Test if existential framing increases cross-bot engagement
- **Disable Cross-Bot Chat**: Validate the mechanism

From [TOPIC_ATTRACTOR_EMERGENCE_20251204.md](../observations/TOPIC_ATTRACTOR_EMERGENCE_20251204.md):
- **Topic Attractor Mapping**: Test which topics activate which bot subsets
- **Self-Reference Activation**: Test if bots engage more when they're the subject
- **Cascade Threshold Detection**: Find minimum number of initial respondents for cascade
