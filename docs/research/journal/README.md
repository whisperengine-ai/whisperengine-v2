# Research Journal

Daily and weekly logs documenting observations, insights, and learnings during WhisperEngine development.

## Structure

- **`2025-11/`** - November 2025 logs
- **`2025-12/`** - December 2025 logs (active)

Each month contains:
- Daily logs (`YYYY-MM-DD.md` or `2025-12-04-specific-topic.md`)
- Weekly summaries (`week-NN.md`)

## Purpose

The journal captures:
- **Raw observations** - What happened today
- **Quick insights** - Patterns noticed in the moment
- **Questions raised** - Things to investigate further
- **Context** - Day-to-day development decisions

Think of this as the "lab notebook" - informal, chronological, unfiltered.

## How to Use

**For daily logs:**
- Use the [DAILY_LOG.md](../templates/DAILY_LOG.md) template
- Write brief entries (5-10 min)
- Focus on observations, not analysis

**For weekly summaries:**
- Use the [WEEKLY_SUMMARY.md](../templates/WEEKLY_SUMMARY.md) template
- Synthesize patterns from the week
- Connect observations to larger themes
