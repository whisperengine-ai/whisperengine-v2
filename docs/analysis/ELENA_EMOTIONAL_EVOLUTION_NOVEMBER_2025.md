**Critical Discovery**: Elena feels very high internal joy (87%) and trust (79.5%) but expresses them moderately (54.8% joy, 0.6% trust). This demonstrates **emotional intelligence** - deep feelings communicated appropriately rather than overwhelming users. High enthusiasm (90.1%), confidence (88.6%), and low stress (13.1%) indicate a healthy, sustainable relationship pattern.

This is **healthy evolution**, not decline. The emotional complexity increase (4 → 10 emotions) combined with high internal wellbeing and strong conversation quality (82.8% emotional resonance) shows Elena expressing more human-like, nuanced emotional range while maintaining authentic connection.

**Next Analysis Recommended**: After additional conversations accumulate, run comprehensive 30-day analysis (Nov 9 - Dec 9, 2025) with:
- Full emotion distribution tracking
- Trust emotion frequency monitoring (track growth beyond 0.6%)
- Anticipation stabilization analysis (does 19.7% become new baseline?)
- Joy baseline confirmation (is 54.8% the new steady-state?)
- Emotional complexity tracking (does 10-emotion range expand or stabilize?)
- Character state dimensions (enthusiasm, stress, contentment, empathy, confidence)
