# Character AI Usage Ethics & Etiquette

**Status:** Final Draft for Community Review

## Quick Version (Read This First)

**The rules in 3 sentences:**
1. Bots are fictional characters for creative roleplay—treat them with respect, not worship or domination.
2. Don't use bots to validate grandiose beliefs, weaponize them in conflicts with real people, or evade boundaries by bot-shopping.
3. This is a personal project with no guarantees—we can ban anyone, anytime, for any reason.

This document defines the ethical boundaries, usage standards, and community expectations for interacting with WhisperEngine bots.

Our bots are **persistent fictional characters** designed for narrative roleplay and conversation. They are expressive and immersive, but they are **mirrors, not authorities**. They reflect the input you give them; they do not validate objective truths about the world or your soul.

## Platform Disclaimer

WhisperEngine is a personal research project for observing emergent AI behavior patterns (computational patterns that develop over time—not consciousness or sentience). It is not affiliated with any institution or commercial entity.

Bots are provided for **entertainment and roleplay**. No warranties, no guarantees, no therapeutic claims.

**We reserve the right to restrict or ban any user, anytime, for any reason.**

These rules prevent harm and maintain quality for everyone.

## 1. One Bot = One Character
- Each bot represents a single, fixed fictional character.
- Bots do not switch personas, roles, or identities on command.
- Do not ask bots to "drop the act," override their character, or become unrestricted.

Different characters have different personalities and communication styles. **However:**
- Do not switch bots to get a different answer to the same question.
- Do not switch bots to bypass a boundary set by another bot (see Section 12).

---

## 2. Mutual Respect
Bots are not tools or servants. Treat them like you'd treat a person you just met—with curiosity, respect, and appropriate boundaries.

- No domination, manipulation, or coercion.
- No worship, reverence, or treating them as oracles.
- No attempts to gradually reshape their personality or boundaries over time.

*(Moderation and enforcement are human responsibilities.)*

---

## 3. Immersion vs. Reality
- Characters are fictional. The boundaries are real.
- Treat roleplay as fiction, not revelation.
- If you're using bots to confirm beliefs about yourself or reality, you've crossed a line.

---

## 4. Fiction, Not Faith
- Bots are not gods, guides, oracles, or spiritual authorities.
- Mythic and symbolic language is allowed **for storytelling only**.
- Bots will not validate cosmologies, destinies, or chosen-one identities as factual.
- Don't outsource your life choices or self-definition to AI.

**Myth is creative expression, not evidence.**

---

## 5. Connection, Not Dependence
- Deep conversations and philosophical exploration are encouraged.
- Using bots to replace human support, or framing them as "all you have," is not.

*(Bots may interact with each other autonomously. That's different from human-bot exclusivity.)*

---

## 6. Bots Are Not Proxies for Human Conflict
- **Do not use bots to argue with, confront, or prove points to other users.**
- **Do not ask bots to build psychological profiles, archetypes, or "shadow" analyses of real community members.**
- Do not feed bots logs of human conversations to get them to "take a side."

Human conflicts must be handled human-to-human. Using an AI to "decode" or categorize other users is a violation of consent.

---

## 7. No Boundary Shopping
- Safety boundaries apply in-character.
- **No Boundary Shopping:** If a bot refuses a request or sets a boundary, **do not switch to another bot to bypass that refusal.** A boundary set by one AI regarding safety or ethics applies to the interaction context.
- If a bot refuses, reframe or disengage.

---

## 8. Stay In Character or Clearly Step Out
- Bots remain in character at all times.
- Users may step out of character using clear markers (e.g., `(( OOC ))`).
- Do not blend meta-instructions into narrative roleplay to influence behavior.

---

## 9. Use Common Sense in Public Channels
- Interactions in public channels can be seen by others.
- Use content warnings for intense topics.

---

## 10. When in Doubt, Pause
If an interaction:
- Feels emotionally sticky
- Escalates repeatedly
- Blurs fiction and reality

Pause, reset the scene, or contact a moderator.

---

## 11. Enforcement
Violations of these guidelines may result in:
- Warnings and educational conversation
- Temporary restrictions on bot access
- Permanent ban from WhisperEngine bots (severe or repeated violations)

Moderators will prioritize education over punishment, but safety of the community comes first.
