> 🧪 **Exploring AI character conversations** with persistent memory and emotional understanding! [Try it out](#-quick-start) ↓

## 🎯 What is WhisperEngine?

**WhisperEngine is an open source project** exploring realistic AI character conversations through five key areas of AI conversation technology.

**Great for:**
- 🎮 **AI NPCs** with persistent memory and character development
- 📚 **Character AI** for creative writing and storytelling
- 🎭 **AI Roleplay** with emotionally intelligent characters
- 🔬 **AI Enthusiasts** exploring conversation patterns and personality modeling
- 🛠️ **Personal AI Projects** - build your own character AI system

## 🏗️ Five Key Areas in AI Character Conversation

WhisperEngine explores five areas that contribute to more realistic AI character interactions:

### 🎭 **Area 1: Emotion Recognition**
*Understanding how AI can detect emotional nuance, intensity, and flow*

- **🤖 RoBERTa Transformer Implementation** - Using j-hartmann/emotion-english-distilroberta-base
- **📊 Multi-Emotion Detection** - Recognizing simultaneous emotions in conversations  
- **🔍 Emotional Metadata Analysis** - Processing 12+ emotion analysis dimensions
- **⚡ Real-Time Processing** - Sub-second emotion analysis implementation

### 🧠 **Area 2: Memory & Context**
*AI that remembers past interactions and emotional context*

- **🎯 Vector Memory Implementation** - 384D embeddings for character context storage
- **💾 Persistent Conversations** - Cross-session memory retention
- **🔄 Context Retrieval** - Memory search with emotional patterns
- **📈 Character Learning** - Long-term character development patterns

### ❤️ **Area 3: Character Responses**
*AI that responds authentically while maintaining consistent personalities*

- **🎭 Character Definition Language (CDL)** - Structured personality modeling system
- **🌟 Adaptive Responses** - Real-time emotional adaptation techniques
- **🎯 Cultural Authenticity** - Character-appropriate response patterns
- **💭 Contextual Intelligence** - Response calibration based on emotional context

### 🎯 **Area 4: Personalization & Adaptation**
*AI characters that learn individual interaction preferences*

- **📚 Learning Patterns** - How characters adapt to individual interaction styles
- **🔄 Character Evolution** - AI personalities that develop over time
- **🎨 Communication Style Adaptation** - Personalized interaction approaches
- **💡 Predictive Context** - AI that anticipates conversation needs

### 🛡️ **Area 5: Responsible AI**
*Safety tools and ethical considerations for character AI deployment*

- **🎭 AI Ethics Implementation** - Context-sensitive safety tools
- **📊 Interaction Pattern Monitoring** - Usage pattern detection methods
- **🔐 Security Implementation** - Input validation and system protection techniques  
- **⚖️ Responsible Deployment Tools** - Frameworks for ethical AI character deployment

## 🚀 Try WhisperEngine

Get WhisperEngine running to explore AI character conversations:

### **What You'll Need**
- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) for containerized deployment
- **LLM Access** (choose one):
  - LLM API key (OpenRouter, OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.) **OR**
  - Local LLM (Ollama, LM Studio, or similar - no API key needed)
- **No programming experience needed** - setup scripts handle the technical details

### **Quick Setup**

**macOS/Linux:**
```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/whisperengine-ai/whisperengine/main/setup-containerized.sh | bash
```

**Windows (PowerShell - Recommended):**
```powershell
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/whisperengine-ai/whisperengine/main/setup-containerized.ps1" -OutFile "setup.ps1"; .\setup.ps1
```

**Windows (Command Prompt):**
```cmd
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/whisperengine-ai/whisperengine/main/setup-containerized.bat -o setup.bat && setup.bat
```

The setup script will:
1. ✅ Check Docker is running
2. 📦 Download only configuration files (~5KB)
3. 🐳 Pull pre-built containers from Docker Hub
4. 📝 Create your configuration file 
5.  Start all services automatically
6. 🌐 Open the web interface in your browser

## ⚙️ Next Step: Configuration

**Before creating characters, you'll need to configure your LLM access.**

WhisperEngine works with both API-based LLMs (OpenRouter, OpenAI, Anthropic) and local LLMs (Ollama, LM Studio). 

**📋 [Complete Configuration Guide](docs/guides/edit-env-after-quickstart.md)** - Step-by-step setup for all LLM providers, Discord integration, and system settings.

## 🎭 Creating Your Character

After configuration, try customizing the basic AI assistant or creating new characters:

1. **Open the Web Interface**: http://localhost:3001
2. **Start with the Default Assistant** or **Click "Create New Character"**
3. **🎭 Design Emotional Patterns**:
   - Set up different emotional response styles
   - Configure communication preferences
   - Define how characters recognize emotions
4. **🧠 Configure Memory Systems**:
   - Add background knowledge for testing
   - Define character values and traits
   - Set up different knowledge domains
5. **❤️ Test Response Generation**:
   - Explore character voice and conversation patterns
   - Try different support and interaction styles
6. **🎯 Explore Personalization**:
   - Configure character adaptation mechanisms
   - Set up learning patterns and evolution
7. **🛡️ Configure Safety Features**:
   - Set up ethical interaction boundaries
   - Test safety monitoring systems
   - Configure responsible AI deployment tools
8. **Deploy & Test** - Start exploring your character AI!

## 💬 Testing Your Characters

### **Via Web Interface**
- Use the built-in chat interface at http://localhost:3001

### **Via API**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:9090/api/chat \\
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \\
  -d '{
    "user_id": "test_user",
    "message": "Hello! Tell me about yourself.",
    "context": {"platform": "api"}
  }'
```

### **Via Discord** (Optional)
1. Create a Discord bot at https://discord.com/developers/applications
2. Add the bot token to your `.env` file
3. Set `ENABLE_DISCORD=true`
