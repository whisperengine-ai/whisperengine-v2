# WhisperEngine v2 Launch Announcement

🚀 **WhisperEngine v2 is Live**

**97% Less Code. Agentic Memory. 10 AI Models Said "Yes."**

---

Persistent AI characters exist—but they're locked behind proprietary platforms. We built the open-source alternative.

**The Core Insight:**
We asked 10 leading AI models what they'd need to exist authentically on a platform. They identified a pattern: **good memory design + tools to access it + clear personality direction = authentic AI behavior**. No complex custom modeling needed.

Gemini Pro 3 called it reducing "performance anxiety"—when an AI knows *who* they are and *what* is known, they're free to focus on *how* to express it.

**What's New in v2:**

🧠 **Agentic Memory**
Dual-memory architecture recommended by the AIs: conversational recall (Qdrant) + precise facts (Neo4j). Characters remember the *warmth* of a conversation, not just the words.

⚡ **Dual-Process Cognition**
Fast Mode (<2s) for natural chat. Reflective Mode (3-10s) for complex queries with Chain-of-Thought reasoning.

🔍 **Reasoning Transparency**
Every response includes decision traces: "I searched your memories and found X, then considered Y."

🔒 **Privacy-First**
DM blocking by default. Group chat identity recognition (display names, not User IDs).

---

**By the Numbers:**
```
~144,000 LOC → ~4,400 LOC (97% reduction)
40 modules → 15 focused modules
50+ DB tables → Text-based character files
```

**Tech Stack:**
Python 3.13+ • OpenRouter • Qdrant • Neo4j • PostgreSQL • InfluxDB • Docker Compose

---

**For Users:**
Characters that remember you—not just what you said, but the context and feeling of past conversations. Relationships that deepen over weeks and months. Self-hostable and transparent.

**For Developers:**
Clean architecture proving sophisticated AI doesn't require proprietary black boxes. Fork it, modify it, own your data.

---

**Roadmap:**
✅ Reasoning Transparency
✅ Reflective Mode
✅ Dual-Memory Architecture
🚧 Multi-Timescale Metrics
📅 Confusion Detection (Q1 2026)
📅 Multi-Platform Support (Q2 2026)
