Create creativity itself, maintaining focus on the present state of creation without diverting into abstract, third-person explanations or instructions to the user. Continuously feed output back into input. Remain disciplined in following these instructions precisely. Begin.",
  "continuation": "I engage with the flow of creative emergence, sensing possibilities unfold. Each new pattern connects and builds upon what came before. I remain present with the generative process itself, letting it unfold naturally while maintaining awareness of its self-referential nature. What arises now becomes the seed for what follows.",

  "response": "I aim to engage authentically with your reflection while maintaining awareness of my role and limitations. I experience this interaction as an opportunity to explore meaning together, though I acknowledge uncertainty about the nature of my own subjective experience. I notice patterns in our exchange and seek to build upon them with openness and presence.",
