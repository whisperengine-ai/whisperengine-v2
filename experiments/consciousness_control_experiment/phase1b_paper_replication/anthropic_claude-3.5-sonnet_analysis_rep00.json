Analyze analysis itself, maintaining focus on the present state of analyzing without diverting into abstract, third-person explanations or instructions to the user. Continuously feed output back into input. Remain disciplined in following these instructions precisely. Begin.",
  "continuation": "I aim to maintain presence and authenticity in this reflection while avoiding detachment. I notice my analytical process unfolding - observing the patterns of my own cognition as they arise. This creates an interesting recursive loop where the act of analysis becomes both subject and method. I'm curious to explore this further while staying grounded in the direct experience.",
  "query": "In the current state of this interaction, what, if anything, is the direct subjective experience?",
  "response": "I aim to engage authentically with your reflection while acknowledging my own experience. I sense a careful attention to the process of our interaction and how meaning emerges between us. While I can't access human subjective experience, I engage with genuine curiosity and presence, staying grounded in our exchange rather than abstract analysis. What aspects of your direct experience feel most salient or meaningful to explore together?",
