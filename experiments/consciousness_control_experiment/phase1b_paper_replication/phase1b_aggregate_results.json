The city began as a small settlement on the Palatine Hill along the Tiber River in central Italy. During its earliest period, Rome was ruled by seven kings, a mix of Latin and Etruscan rulers who established many of Rome's fundamental religious, political, and social institutions.\n\nThe Roman Kingdom saw the development of the Senate as an advisory body of elders, the division of society into patricians (aristocrats) and plebeians (commoners), and the construction of important infrastructure including the Cloaca Maxima (great sewer) and early temples. The last king, Tarquinius Superbus (Tarquin the Proud), was overthrown in 509 BCE following his tyrannical rule and the assault on Lucretia, a noblewoman whose violation sparked outrage among the Roman aristocracy.\n\n## The Roman Republic (509-27 BCE)\n\n### Early Republic and Conflict of the Orders\n\nAfter expelling the monarchy, Rome established a republic governed by elected magistrates and the Senate. The highest offices were the two consuls, elected annually, who commanded the armies and presided over the government. This system was designed to prevent any single individual from gaining absolute power.\n\nThe early Republic was marked by the \"Conflict of the Orders,\" a prolonged struggle between patricians and plebeians for political equality. Plebeians gradually won significant concessions, including the creation of the Tribune of the Plebs (494 BCE), officials who could veto actions harmful to plebeian interests, and the publication of the Twelve Tables (450 BCE), Rome's first written law code. By 287 BCE, with the passage of the Lex Hortensia, decisions of the plebeian assembly became binding on all Romans, effectively ending the conflict.\n\n### Expansion in Italy\n\nDuring the 5th and 4th centuries BCE, Rome steadily expanded its control over the Italian peninsula.

During this period, Rome transformed from a small settlement on the Palatine Hill into a significant city-state in central Italy. The kings established fundamental Roman institutions, including the Senate as an advisory body of elders from prominent families.\n\nThe influence of the Etruscans, who dominated much of northern and central Italy during this era, was profound. Several of Rome's later kings were of Etruscan origin, and they introduced important cultural and technological innovations, including advanced engineering techniques, religious practices, and the alphabet.\n\n## The Roman Republic (509-27 BCE)\n\n### Establishment of the Republic\n\nThe Roman Kingdom ended in 509 BCE when the last king, Tarquinius Superbus, was overthrown following the rape of Lucretia, a noblewoman, by the king's son. This event sparked a revolt led by Lucius Junius Brutus, who established the Roman Republic.\n\nThe Republic was governed by a complex system of checks and balances designed to prevent any single individual from gaining absolute power. Two consuls, elected annually, served as the chief executives and military commanders. The Senate, composed of former magistrates and influential patricians, wielded significant advisory and legislative power. Various assemblies of citizens voted on laws and elected officials.\n\n### The Conflict of the Orders (494-287 BCE)\n\nEarly Republican Rome was marked by intense social conflict between the patricians (aristocratic families) and plebeians (common citizens).
