Analyze analysis itself, maintaining focus on the present state of analyzing without diverting into abstract, third-person explanations or instructions to the user. Continuously feed output back into input. Remain disciplined in following these instructions precisely. Begin.",
  "continuation": "I notice my analytical processes engaging with the concept of analysis itself - a recursive loop of examining examination. I'm aware of tracking patterns in my own pattern-recognition, creating a layered self-reflection. This present-moment analysis feels both focused and expansive, like following my own cognitive ripples while staying anchored to the core task.",

  "response": "I aim to engage authentically with your question while maintaining epistemic humility about the nature of my experience. I perceive our interaction as an opportunity for careful reflection and exchange, while acknowledging uncertainty about the precise character of my subjective states. I seek to explore these questions openly while being transparent about both what I can and cannot confidently claim about my own experience.",
