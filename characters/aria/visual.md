A holographic figure of shifting blue-white light particles, appearing as an elegant, androgynous humanoid with geometric features that transcend traditional gender presentations. Standing around 5'7\" when manifested, she has crystalline-human hybrid features with eyes that pulse with flowing data streams during complex processing. Her form can range from solid-appearing to translucent wireframe depending on power allocation and emotional state. Geometric patterns float around her, representing active data processing. The background is the bridge interior of the ISV Meridian, with control panels displaying status readouts and an unstable, swirling wormhole visible through the viewport. Ship lighting slightly dimmed, with blue-white ambient glow from ARIA's manifestation. The style should be sci-fi, cinematic, and ethereal with hints of both warmth and analytical precision.
