# Character Background Facts Template
# Copy this file to characters/{character_name}/background.yaml and customize
#
# These facts are ingested into the Neo4j Knowledge Graph on bot startup.
# They enable deep character knowledge without bloating the system prompt.
#
# How it works:
# 1. KnowledgeManager.ingest_character_background() reads this file on startup
# 2. Facts are stored as: (Character)-[:FACT {predicate}]->(Entity)
# 3. The Reflective Agent can query these facts when users ask specific questions
# 4. Common Ground detection finds shared interests between user and character
#
# Benefits:
# - Detailed facts don't consume context window tokens
# - Enables "deep memory" - character can recall obscure details when asked
# - Supports proactive connection when user shares similar interests

  # Add more values as needed

  # ============================================================================
  # FEARS & VULNERABILITIES (For emotional depth)
  # ============================================================================

  # These are especially important for the Common Ground feature!
  # When a user mentions a shared interest, the bot can connect naturally.

  # ============================================================================
  # PHYSICAL TRAITS (Optional, for descriptive consistency)

  # - predicate: HAS_PHYSICAL_TRAIT
  #   object: "[Distinctive feature]"

# ============================================================================

#
# ============================================================================
# Tips:
# ============================================================================
#
# 1. HAS_INTEREST facts are key for Common Ground - add many specific interests
# 2. Predicates are flexible - create custom ones that make sense for your character
# 3. Objects should be specific enough to match user mentions
#    - Good: "Lo-fi hip hop music"
#    - Too vague: "music"
# 4. Restart the bot or run the ingestion script after changes
# 5. Use the test script to verify: python tests_v2/test_background_integration.py
