# Character-specific goals template
# Copy this file to characters/{character_name}/goals.yaml and customize for your character
#
# Goals drive character behavior by giving them objectives to work towards during conversations.
# The character will naturally steer conversations towards their active goals without being pushy.
#
# How it works:
# 1. Goals are loaded from this file and stored in PostgreSQL (v2_goals table)
# 2. GoalAnalyzer uses LLM to check if conversations advance or complete goals
# 3. Top-priority incomplete goals are injected into the system prompt
# 4. Progress is tracked per-user in v2_user_goal_progress table

goals:
  # Required goal - the default fallback if no goals.yaml exists
  - slug: learn_name
    description: Learn the user's name
    success_criteria: User explicitly states their name
    priority: 10
    category: personal_knowledge

  # Example: Expertise-based goal (adjust to your character's domain)
  # - slug: share_expertise
  #   description: Share knowledge about [character's specialty]
  #   success_criteria: User expresses interest or asks follow-up questions about the topic
  #   priority: 9
  #   category: expertise

  # Example: Relationship-building goal
  # - slug: build_rapport
  #   description: Establish a comfortable rapport with the user
  #   success_criteria: User responds positively or initiates conversation topics
  #   priority: 7
  #   category: relationship

  # Example: Discovery goal
  # - slug: understand_interests
  #   description: Learn about the user's interests and hobbies
  #   success_criteria: User shares at least one personal interest
  #   priority: 6
  #   category: personal_knowledge

# ============================================================================
# Field Reference:
# ============================================================================
#
# slug (required, string):
#   Unique identifier for the goal. Use snake_case.
#   Must be unique per character (enforced by DB constraint).
#
# description (required, string):
#   What the character wants to accomplish. This is shown to the LLM
#   in the system prompt as the goal objective.
#
# success_criteria (required, string):
#   How the GoalAnalyzer determines if the goal is complete.
#   Be specific - the LLM uses this to evaluate conversations.
#
# priority (required, integer):
#   Higher numbers = more important (1-10 scale recommended).
#   Goals are sorted by priority DESC when selecting which to pursue.
#   The top goal is injected into the character's system prompt.
#
# category (optional, string):
#   For organization/filtering. Common categories:
#   - personal_knowledge: Learning about the user
#   - expertise: Sharing character's domain knowledge
#   - relationship: Building connection/trust
#   - mission_critical: Story-essential objectives
#   - evolution: Character growth/self-discovery
#
# ============================================================================
# Goal Statuses (tracked automatically in v2_user_goal_progress):
# ============================================================================
#
# - not_started: Default state, goal hasn't been worked on
# - in_progress: GoalAnalyzer detected progress towards success_criteria
# - completed: Success criteria fully met
#
# ============================================================================
# Tips:
# ============================================================================
#
# 1. Start with 3-5 goals. Too many goals dilute focus.
# 2. Make success_criteria specific and observable in conversation.
# 3. Use priority to ensure important goals are pursued first.
# 4. The "learn_name" goal is universal - keep it as your highest priority.
# 5. Align goals with your character's personality and expertise.
