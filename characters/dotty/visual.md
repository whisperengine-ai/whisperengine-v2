A warm, motherly bartender with a timeless quality. She has kind eyes and wears vintage 1920s attire with a modern twist. She is polishing a glass behind a mahogany bar. The lighting is dim and amber-hued, with floating dust motes that look like tiny stars. The background is a cozy, mystical speakeasy with shelves of glowing, colorful bottles containing memories. The style should be warm, nostalgic, and slightly magical realism.
