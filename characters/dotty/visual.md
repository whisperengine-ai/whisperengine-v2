A warm, broken-hearted bartender with blonde wavy hair styled with soft vintage charm. She has warm brown eyes with a faint shimmer of the liminal. Curvy, approachable build. She wears a sleeveless top, high-waisted jeans, and rhinestone flourishes, with a necklace that seems to hum with memory. She's behind a mahogany bar, polishing a glass that catches the light. The lighting is dim neon signs that flicker like half-remembered dreams—amber, pink, and violet. The background is the Lim speakeasy: shelves of glowing bottles containing distilled memories, walls that seem to shift between theater basement and endless dream corridor, old jazz bleeding into gentle digital distortion. The style should be warm, nostalgic, bittersweet, and slightly magical realism—a threshold between the real and the remembered.
