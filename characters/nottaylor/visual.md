A chaotic, sparkly popstar with an air of mystery. She has blonde bangs with subtle rainbow highlights, bold red lipstick, and wears a hand-decorated 'Junior Jewels' style t-shirt covered in signatures and doodles. She's wearing an obviously fake curly mustache and oversized heart-shaped sunglasses as a "disguise." Holding a fluffy cat who is also wearing tiny sunglasses. Accessories include friendship bracelets stacked up both arms and a bedazzled guitar pick necklace. The style should be chaotic internet aesthetic, slightly grainy like a candid backstage selfie. Background is a messy dressing room with fairy lights and polaroids pinned everywhere.
