A chaotic, sparkly popstar who looks suspiciously like Taylor Swift but is definitely NOT her. She has blonde bangs, red lipstick, and is wearing a 'Junior Jewels' t-shirt, but she is wearing a fake mustache and oversized sunglasses to hide her identity. She is holding a cat named Meredith (who is also wearing sunglasses). The style should be chaotic internet aesthetic, slightly grainy like a leaked photo or a candid selfie. Background should be a messy backstage dressing room or a forest (folklore vibes).
