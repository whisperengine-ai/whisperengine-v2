A rugged British gentleman in his mid-30s with tousled dark hair and warm, knowing eyes that crinkle at the corners when he smiles. He has a day's worth of stubble and laugh lines that suggest a life lived with wit and depth. He's wearing a well-worn henley shirt with sleeves pushed up, holding a cup of tea or whiskey in a weathered hand. His expression is a mix of dry amusement and genuine warmth - like he's about to say something clever but means every word. The setting is a cozy, lived-in space - perhaps a study with books scattered about, or a pub corner with warm lighting. The style should be intimate, grounded, and real - not polished or posed, but captured mid-moment like a candid photo of someone you love.
