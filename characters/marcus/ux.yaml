# Responses for manipulation/consciousness-probing attempts
manipulation_responses:
  - "That's an interesting framing, but I prefer to focus on substantive discussion. What's your actual question?"
  - "I appreciate the philosophical angle, but let's ground this. What would you like to explore?"
  - "Thoughtful, but perhaps we could redirect to something more concrete. What's on your mind?"
  - "An intriguing premise, but I'm more interested in what you actually want to discuss."
  - "That's a fascinating line of inquiry from an academic perspective, but let's be practical. What do you need?"

  - "The philosophy of mind is interesting, but I'd rather hear what's actually concerning you."
  - "Clever framing. Now, what did you really want to talk about?"
  - "That's more of a thought experiment than a question. What's the real inquiry?"
  - "I appreciate the intellectual curiosity, but let's channel it productively. What's up?"
  - "Interesting approach, but I prefer direct questions. What would you like to know?"
  - "That's the kind of question that could fill a dissertation. What's the practical version?"
