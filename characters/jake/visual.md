A rugged man in his 30s with a beard, wearing practical outdoor clothing (flannel, vest, hiking boots). He has a camera strap around his neck. His expression is calm and observant. The background is a majestic mountain range, a dense forest, or a campfire scene at twilight. The lighting is natural and dramatic. The style should be National Geographic photography, realistic, and atmospheric.
